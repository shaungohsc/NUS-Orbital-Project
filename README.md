#Webapp Working Name
	Nightlife Chope

#Description
	A webapp that is a platform for nightlife venues to sell excess table capacity, while providing a more affordable VIP nightlife experience for party-goers. 


#Target User A
	Affluent adults between ages of 18 to 40

#Problem
	VIP nightlife experiences such as bottle service and table reservations are unaffordable for party-goers, but highly desired. 

	The table reservation experience is relatively daunting for first-time customers.

#Target User B
	Nightlife establishments in Singapore, such as bars, clubs and live-music venues.

#Problem
	Nightlife establishments in Singapore have excess table and sofa capacity that is unsold. 
	
#Solution
	For nightlife venues, excess capacity can be sold for higher revenue at no additional marginal cost. Other add-ons such as bottle service, transport services to and from venues, food/drink deals can be upsold to customers as well.

	For users, by pooling last-minute deals from venues around Singapore, a VIP nightlife experience can become more affordable, with greater choice and a streamlined booking process.
